<h2>Design Manifesto</h2>

<p>When it comes to the web there is just one simple thing to keep in mind. Simplicity. With all of the tools that are available to us, we can quickly design too much and take away for the aesthetic of the page. Just design something that is simple and is what you like.<p>

<h4>Get out of your head</h4>
<p>Too many times designers, especially young designers, try to look at other individual's work for inspiration. Sometimes this is ok, but what you think is good work may be different for someone else. Design what YOU think is good and makes YOU happy with the work. Get creative with what you design, and that can be something that is unique to you. You can produce good work if you just get out of your head.</p>

<h4>Simple Simple Simple</h4>
<p>Yes, I know I have said this over and over, but it is true. When designing, keep it simple. Just because you have all the power to do things doesn't mean you should. It is always better to produce some that is straight to the point instead of putting in all of the fluff.<p>

<h4>Clean and Easy</h4>
<p>When it comes to keeping things simple, you should think of the simple things such as font and colors. Colors are great. They can truly show the emotion, but too much can become distracting. So, keep a white background and use black text. Then, go back and add in accent colors to brighten the mood. There are also a lot of fonts that we all love to use, bt use one. Use on that is on EVERY computer and is easy to read, and of course, is clean. An easy go-to is Helvetica or Arial.</p>

<p>We have the power to make the web a fun place. So let's do that. Go out there and design what you think looks amazing! Even if someone doesn't like it, there are probably a lot more people that do like it. Just one hint: Keep it Simple. Just double think before you turn your background to hot pink with lavender accent colors. Design on.</p>
